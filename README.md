# EcoTube

Install this Chrome extension to make YouTube blazing fast!

The desktop web page version of YouTube is very inefficient that it often consumes much more resources than it should be. The most apparent one is when seeking videos and switching to and from full screen mode. Doing both activities on the desktop YouTube web will max out at least a single core CPU.

This extension will make Chrome load the Android version of the YouTube page and performs on-the-fly modifications to the page to make it easier to operate the web page using the keyboard and mouse.

This extension provides the following keyboard shortcuts:

- <kbd>Arrow Left</kbd>  
  Seek video backward for 5 seconds.
- <kbd>Arrow Right</kbd>  
  Seek video forward for 5 seconds.
- <kbd>Space</kbd>  
  Toggle play or pause the video.
- <kbd>F</kbd>  
  Toggle full screen mode.
- <kbd>T</kbd>  
  Toggle theatre mode (video occupies whole window width).
- <kbd>[</kbd>  
  Slow down video by a factor of 0.25x.
- <kbd>]</kbd>  
  Speed up video by a factor of 0.25x (maximum 4x speed).
